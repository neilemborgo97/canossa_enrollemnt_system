Canossa Kindergarten and Day Care Center: Web-based Enrollment System

1.1 Background of the Study

Enrollment is a crucial process in any educational institution, ensuring that students are properly registered for classes. At Canossa Kindergarten and Day Care Center, the enrollment process is currently handled manually, requiring parents to visit the school, fill out paper forms, and wait for staff to encode their information into the system. This traditional method is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to errors, leading to inefficiencies that affect both parents and school administrators.
With advancements in technology, many schools have transitioned to digital solutions to streamline their enrollment processes. An automated enrollment system can significantly improve efficiency by minimizing manual data entry, reducing processing time, and ensuring the accuracy of student records. This study aims to develop a web-based enrollment system that will enhance the enrollment experience for parents while reducing administrative workload at Canossa Kindergarten and Day Care Center. The system will enable digital registration, automated student record management, class assignments, and payment tracking, ensuring a seamless and organized process.

1.2 Statement of the Problem

The current enrollment system at Canossa Kindergarten and Day Care Center is entirely manual, leading to inefficiencies and potential errors in data processing. Parents must physically visit the school to fill out enrollment forms, which are then manually encoded by staff. This process is time-consuming and prone to delays, especially during peak enrollment periods. Additionally, manual data entry increases the risk of errors in student records, teacher assignments, and payment processing.
The lack of an automated system also limits accessibility, requiring parents to be physically present for every enrollment-related transaction. Furthermore, tracking student records, class assignments, and payment statuses becomes challenging without a centralized digital system. The absence of real-time updates and automated confirmations can cause miscommunication between parents, teachers, and administrators.
To address these challenges, a web-based enrollment system is needed to streamline the process, reduce administrative workload, minimize errors, and provide parents with a more convenient and efficient way to enroll their children. By implementing a digital enrollment system, Canossa Kindergarten and Day Care Center can enhance operational efficiency, improve data accuracy, and offer a seamless experience for both staff and parents.

1.5 Scope and Limitation

Scope:

This study focuses on the development of an Elementary School Enrollment System for Canossa Kindergarten and Day Care Center, automating student registration, re-enrollment, class assignment, and payment tracking. The system will be web-based, allowing administrators, teachers, and parents to access it via an internet browser. The main features include:

•	A student database for managing student records.
•	An online enrollment process to replace manual paperwork.
•	Automated scheduling and class assignment for students and teachers.
•	Real-time report generation for efficient administrative operations.
•	Payment tracking for school fees (manual entry by the admin).

Limitation:

The system is specifically designed for elementary school enrollment and does not cover high school or college admissions. It does not support online payment processing but will record payments manually entered by school staff. The system requires internet access to function and will not have offline capabilities. Additionally, this system focuses solely on enrollment and administrative tasks and does not replace teacher-student interaction in the classroom.
